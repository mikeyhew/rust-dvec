# rust-dvec
A double-ended Vec that, unlike VecDeque, stores its elements in a contiguous array.

Hey there. This is some code I wrote, after getting the idea from [this answer on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/43030703/4302668). It's not really finished, and I'm not sure I'll ever finish it... but if you're interested, I'll release it with a permissive license so you can use it as a starting point.
